# **1. Introduction**

## **1.1. What is a GitHub Project?**
A tool for organizing tasks, tracking issues, pull requests, milestones, and more.

## **1.2. Benefits**
- **Task Management:** Track work across stages.  
- **Collaboration:** Work seamlessly with teammates.  
- **Milestone Tracking:** Set goals and deadlines.

## **1.3. Who Should Use GitHub Projects?**
- **Developers:** Manage code changes and tasks.  
- **Project Managers:** Plan and track timelines.  
- **Collaborators:** View status and contribute.

---

# **2. Setting Up Your GitHub Project**

## **2.1 From the Web**
- Go to the repository â†’ Projects tab â†’ New Project.  
- Select a template (Kanban, Basic, Roadmap).

## **2.2 From VS Code**
Why we cannot do this from  VS code ??

- Repository:
A repository (or "repo") is a storage space for your project files and their version history. It can be hosted on platforms like GitHub.
When you create a repository on GitHub, you create a container for your project.
- Project:
A project refers to the actual work you are doing, which includes code, documentation, and other assets.
In GitHub, "project" can also refer to a feature for organizing tasks (like Kanban boards), but this is separate from the repository.
- Linking:
You can use git remote add origin <repository-url> to link your local Git repository to a remote GitHub repository.
You cannot link a "project" directly because Git operates at the repository level. Your local project must first be a Git repository (initialized with git init) before you can link it to a remote repository.

# **3. How GitHub Projects Work**

## **3.1. Milestones**
Checkpoints for issue sets (e.g., releases).

## **3.2. Issues & Sub-issues**
Represent tasks or bugs.

## **3.3. Tags (Labels)**
Categorize issues (e.g., bug, feature).

## **3.4. Branches**
Develop features separately and merge into main.

## **3.5. Comments**
Enable discussion and feedback.

## **3.6. Assigning People**
Allocate tasks to team members.

---

# **4. Visualizations in GitHub Projects**

## **4.1. Dashboard View**
Kanban-style, columns like To Do, In Progress, Done.

## **4.2. Board (Kanban) View**
Customizable stages (e.g., Code Review, Testing).

## **4.3. Timeline View**
Calendar view for tasks and milestones.

## **4.4. Automated Views**
Auto-updates based on actions like closing issues.

## 1. Setting Up Automation in GitHub Projects

## 2. Workflow Creation (Step-by-Step)
A workflow in GitHub Actions is an automated set of tasks that run in response to specific events, such as pushing code to the repository. Here's the process:

### a. Create the Directory
Create a folder named `.github/workflows` within your repository. This is the default location where YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) files for automation should be placed.

### b. Add a YAML File
The YAML file defines triggers and automated tasks (jobs). Here's an example of a simple YAML file:

```yaml
name: Run Tests
on: [push] # Triggered when code is pushed to the repository
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # The environment to run the job
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Downloads the repository code
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test # Executes the tests defined in your project
```

- **name:** The name of the workflow.
- **on:** The event that triggers the workflow, in this case, `push` (code push).
- **jobs:** The tasks to execute, here there's only one job named `test`.
- **steps:** The steps of the job, including checking out the code and running tests (`npm test`).

### c. Push the YAML File
Push the file to the repository. Once uploaded, GitHub will start the automation every time the configured trigger is activated (in this example, on every push).

### Example of CI/CD with GitHub Actions
The following example extends automation to implement a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Only triggers when code is pushed to the "main" branch
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
        
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test # This job runs only if the "test" job is successful
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./deploy_script.sh # Executes a custom deployment script
```

- Two jobs: `test` and `deploy`.
- **needs:** Ensures that `deploy` only runs if `test` completed without errors.
- **deploy_script.sh:** A custom script to deploy your application to production.

---

## 3. Triggers in GitHub Actions
Triggers are events that start a workflow. Common examples include:
- **Push Event:** Triggered when code is pushed to a branch.
- **Pull Request Event:** Triggered when a pull request is created or updated.
- **Scheduled Event:** Automates tasks at a set time (using cron jobs, like every Monday at 9 am).
- **Issue/PR Comment Event:** Triggers when a comment is added to an issue or pull request.

Example YAML for a push event to the `main` branch:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

---

## 4. Where to Place the YAML File
You must save the YAML file in the following path within your repository:

```plaintext
.github/workflows/
```

If the file is not in this specific location, GitHub will not detect the automation.

---

## 5. Automating Tasks in the GitHub Projects Interface
In addition to YAML files, GitHub Projects offers simpler automation through its interface:
- Automatically moving issues between columns (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress").
- Assigning labels or assignees to issues based on conditions.

### To set this up:
1. Go to the **Projects** tab.
2. Select **Automation**.
3. Set the desired rules.

### When to Use YAML vs. GitHub UI?
- **Use the GitHub Projects UI** for simple and visual automations.
- **Use YAML files in `.github/workflows/`** for advanced automations, like continuous integration, automatic deployments, or complex tasks.
